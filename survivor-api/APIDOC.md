Survivor: Borneo, originally known simply as Survivor or Survivor: Pulau Tiga,
is the first season of the American CBS competitive reality television series
Survivor. The show was filmed from March 13 through April 20, 2000, and premiered
on May 31, 2000. The season consisted participants tasked with being left in a
remote area in Borneo, Malaysia, with minimal tools and supplies. Hosted by
Jeff Probst, it consisted of 39 days with 16 participants being removed by a
majority vote. The series was set in the South China Sea on the remote Malaysian
island of Pulau Tiga in the state of Sabah, about six miles (10 km) off the north
coast of Borneo.[1]
The contestants were initially separated into two tribes, Tagi and Pagong,
which represented the names of the beaches they were on.[1] When 10 players
remained, the contestants merged into one tribe, Rattana. While Tagi and Pagong's
names and makeups were picked by the producers, Rattana was named by contestants
Sean Kenniff and Jenna Lewis, because of the rattan wood that was at their camp.
The series was won by Richard Hatch defeating Kelly Wiglesworth in a 4â€“3 jury vote.
The finale of the season had an average of 51.7 million viewers, the highest of
the franchise. Nielsen reported that 125 million people watched at least some part of
the finale. In 2006, Hatch was sentenced to 51 months in prison after failing to
declare his $1,000,000 winnings.
