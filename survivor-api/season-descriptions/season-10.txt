Survivor: Palau is the tenth season of the American CBS competitive reality television
series Survivor. The season filmed from October 27, 2004, through December 4, 2004, and
premiered on February 17, 2005. Filming took place in Koror, Palau. Hosted by Jeff Probst,
it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 20 competitors, the most the series ever
began with.
For the second time since the series' premiere, the contestants selected the tribes instead of
the producers. The self-selection into two tribes of nine left two contestants not chosen and
immediately eliminated from the game. In the game, Koror dominated from the very beginning,
winning every immunity challenge and all but three reward challenges. Mid-game, having survived
alone at Ulong after the entirety of her tribe had been voted out or eliminated at tribal councils,
its last remaining player, Stephenie LaGrossa received a map to Koror. While the players at the
finale spoke of this as a merger, the producers have described Palau as the only season without
a merge. In the end, fire lieutenant Tom Westman defeated advertising executive Katie Gallagher
in a 6â€“1 jury vote to become the Sole Survivor.
In addition to host Probst naming this as one of his favorite seasons, he stated that the final
immunity challenge was his favorite immunity challenge from any season.[1] He also said Palau was
his favorite filming location.[2] Survivor earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in 2005.
