Survivor: Marquesas is the fourth season of the American CBS competitive reality television series
 Survivor. The season filmed from November 12, 2001, through December 20, 2001, and premiered on
 February 28, 2002. Hosted by Jeff Probst, it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay with 16
 competitors. The Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia were initially selected as a backup
location for Survivor. The original location, Jordan, was discounted as a result of the
September 11 attacks and the political situation in the Middle East.
Vecepia Towery was named Sole Survivor after defeating runner-up Neleh Dennis
by a jury vote of 4-3. This was the first season where the contestants were not given any
initial food, water, or matches. Also, the rules of individual immunity were changed so that a
contestant who won immunity in a challenge was able to give it to another contestant.
A new tiebreaker format was developed in preference of the past-used tiebreaker
involving previous votes cast. The controversial new Purple Rock tiebreaker was used,
resulting in the ousting of Paschal English, then with no votes against him.
