Survivor: Thailand is the fifth season of the American CBS competitive reality television
series Survivor. The season was filmed from June 10, 2002, through July 18, 2002, on the
island of Ko Tarutao in Thailand, and premiered on September 19, 2002. Hosted by Jeff Probst,
it had 16 participants tasked with surviving in the wild for 39 days.
At the live finale, Brian Heidik was named Sole Survivor, defeating runner-up Clay Jordan by a
jury vote of 4â€“3. The season introduced several new gameplay twists. The first occurred on Day 1,
when the two eldest contestants, Jake Billingsley and Jan Gentry, were given the power to pick
their own tribes. This was the first time in Survivor history that the two initial teams were not
preselected by the producers. The second was an offer of mutiny on Day 14: each of the twelve
remaining contestants was given the chance to leave their tribe and join the other if they wished,
though no one took the offer. The third was the fake merge: with ten players remaining,
the two tribes moved onto one beach. They took this to signify a merge, but at the next
challenge they were informed that they were living on one beach, but not yet merged.
