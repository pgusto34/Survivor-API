Survivor: All-Stars is the eighth season of the American CBS competitive reality television
series Survivor. It was filmed from November 3, 2003, through December 11, 2003, and premiered on
February 1, 2004, after Super Bowl XXXVIII. It was filmed on the Pearl Islands of Panama, also the
location of the previous season. Hosted by Jeff Probst, it consisted of the usual 39 days of
gameplay with, for the first time, 18 returning competitors from the seven previous seasons
instead of the usual 16 new contestants, and three tribes instead of the usual two.
The winner was Survivor: The Australian Outback castaway Amber Brkich, who was declared the
Sole Survivor after a victory over Survivor: Marquesas castaway Rob "Boston Rob" Mariano
with a 4â€“3 jury vote. The two had been closely allied throughout the game, and at the live
reunion show just before the votes were read, Brkich accepted a marriage proposal from Mariano.
At the end of the live reunion show, a twist called America's Tribal Council was announced.
It involved the public voting to award a second million-dollar prize. Rupert Boneham won the
million dollars over runners-up Mariano, Colby Donaldson, and Tom Buchanan.
