Survivor: Vanuatu — Islands of Fire, also known as Survivor: Vanuatu, is the ninth season of
the American CBS competitive reality television series Survivor. The season was filmed from
June 28, 2004, through August 5, 2004, and the season premiered on September 16, 2004. Filming
took place in Vanuatu, a chain of volcanic islands in the South Pacific. Hosted by Jeff Probst,
it consisted of the usual 39 days of gameplay, with 18 competitors for the second time
in the series' history.
This was the second season to initially divide the tribes by gender following
Survivor: The Amazon. It was also the first season to feature an amputee
(Chad Crittenden, who had lost a foot to cancer) and two openly LGBT+ women
(motivational speaker Scout Cloud Lee and former Playboy model Ami Cusack).
The winner, Chris Daugherty, was named Sole Survivor after defeating runner-up
Twila Tanner by a jury vote of 5–2.
